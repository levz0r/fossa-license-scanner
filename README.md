## Setup Guide

### 1. FOSSA Account Setup

1. Create a [FOSSA account](https://fossa.com)
2. Set up your project in FOSSA
3. Generate an API key from your FOSSA settings

### 2. GitHub Secrets Configuration

Add your FOSSA API key as a repository secret:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
3. Add a new secret named `FOSSA_API_KEY`
4. Paste your FOSSA API key as the value

### 3. Permissions Setup

Ensure your workflow has the necessary permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read # Required for checkout
  pull-requests: write # Required for PR comments
```

### 4. Project Name Configuration

The `project` input must exactly match your project name in FOSSA. You can find this in:

- Your FOSSA dashboard URL
- FOSSA project settings
- Previous FOSSA configuration files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Project not found" error:**

- Verify the `project` input matches your FOSSA project name exactly
- Check that your API key has access to the project
- Ensure the project exists in your FOSSA account

**"API key invalid" error:**

- Verify your `FOSSA_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
- Check that the API key hasn't expired
- Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions

**No PR comments appearing:**

- Verify the `github-token` has `pull-requests: write` permission
- Check that the action is running on `pull_request` events
- Ensure the workflow has `permissions.pull-requests: write`

**Scan failing on valid licenses:**

- Review your FOSSA project's license policy settings
- Check if new dependencies have been added
- Verify license compatibility with your project's requirements

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` in your repository settings.
